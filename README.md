# enigma-flappy-bird
the first demo game made with enigma, my 3d renderer. enigma in its core is fairly low feature but only does the minumum a render engine should do. handle objects and render them. non or less, as this little game shows, it is already possible to develop some simple games with enigma.

The enigma engine core can be found here: https://github.com/JeremiasMeister/enigma-3d or convenient with running `cargo add enigma-3d` or on https://crates.io/crates/enigma-3d
